##JavaScript
###Language

* [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node) - 
	Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. The Node.js package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
* [ECMA 2015](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) -
	ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the latest version of the ECMAScript standard. ES6 is a significant update to the language, and the first update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009.
* [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) -
	TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types, classes, and modules to JavaScript. TypeScript supports tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript. 

###Frameworks

* [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) -
	AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control.
* [EmberJS](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) -
	Ember.js is a JavaScript framework that does all of the heavy lifting that you'd normally have to do by hand. There are tasks that are common to every web app; Ember.js does those things for you, so you can focus on building killer features and UI.
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) -
	React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Ionic](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic) - 
	Ionic is the open source HTML5 Mobile Framework for building amazing, cross-platform hybrid native apps and mobile websites with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. If you know how to build or design websites, you will be able to build a real mobile app with Ionic!
